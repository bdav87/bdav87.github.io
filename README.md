This page is my playground for learning front end development.
My first project is using Bootstrap. Iterations to the site design will be pushed using Git.

I've been working on websites for 2+ years now, using HTML and CSS to tweak different aspects of theme-based websites. I am ramping up my skills so that I can enter a true developer role in the near future. 

I've always been aware of Git and GitHub, with a vague idea of what they are for. It is crucial to learn how to use version control effectively in order to enter a development role - I've learned this from online courses as well as from my peers in the engineering organization in my current company. Therefore, I will be using Git via command line to push changes to a simple static page hosted on GitHub. This seems like a safe way to learn some elementary development concepts, without the same kinds of risks inherent in self-hosted websites. My ultimate plan is to develop a dynamic web application with server side scripting and database management, but I know enough about secure development to understand the risks involved with system administration. 

Although the base of the page uses Bootstrap, I intend to spruce up the page with my own custom CSS and JavaScript over time.

*Update*
I became a professional Scala and PHP developer. Javascript has changed so much since I first created this repo! It lead me to node.js, and eventually the problems with node.js, which lead me to other backend languages and finally a career :)
